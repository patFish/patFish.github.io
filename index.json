I‚Äôm a swiss software engineer focusing on skipping the bullshit advisory and try to keep it simple. I wrote my first lines of code in BASIC with the age of 12. Today it would qualify as a poor Chatbot about my childhood heroes üòè. Until my study I visited the digitals realm from time to time. Sidenode at least one site is still up and running with the layout of the early days of the internet. During my studies as electrical engineer I explored the depths in the embedded world, loved it but felt there should be more. Therefore I went into Fullstack programming but always at the edge to the physical world where i feel the real interactions happen. My passions circle around multiple streams. I‚Äôm highly addicted to synthetic sugar to certain extend. This means for example I prefer React Hooks or the arrow functions in general over Classes. My thoughts are best expressed or evaluated in a visual or spoken manner. So I tend to visualize and doodle my ideas or better speak about them. This mostly leads myself to find flaws or improvements right away before even getting to the feedback part. One of this blog entries introduces the idea of 5 minute thoughts. A series about trying the approach of writing about ideas to evaluate them. Besides that I see software engineering in any field, Frontend to Backend or Fullstack, as a craft and let myself influence by the values of the craftsmanship movement. This also means I implement and educate best practice approaches as CI/CD or other DevOps related methods in my team daily. Currently I‚Äôm employed as an Application Architect and Fullstack Engineer at an utilities company in ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù switzerland üòâ. Feel free to reach out to me through my mentioned channels.
